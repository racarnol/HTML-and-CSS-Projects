	<h2> kittens hiss if they smell something unfamilar.</h2>
		<p>kittens are born with their eyes and ears sealed, so smell is one of their only senses and allows them to know when danger is close.</p>
	<h2>Short haired kittens vs long haired kittens.</h2>
		<p>Short haired kittens open their eyes sooner then long haired ones</p>
	<h3>Kittens have belly buttons.</h3>
		<p> Just like people, kittens have belly buttons as well! Each kitten have their own amniotic sack and umbilical cord.</p>
